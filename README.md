This Repository based on windows application to save data in database using XML.
This repo is an example how we can stored data into SQL database table using XML input parameter.
This way you can save N number of column by binding that into XML string and pass into database procedure. No need to pass seperate parameter for each value.
in one stored proecdure you can perform all the oepration in single procedure by seperating those by flag checking.
